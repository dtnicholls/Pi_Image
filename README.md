# Pi_Image
Digits of pi, in a circle with the letter pi in the middle.

Simple python script to generate the example.png image.
Asks what size circle, what size letter and what size text, all in mm. Can have either white or transparent backgrounds.

You will need the pi.txt and GARABD.ttf files in the same directory as the script.

You will also need pillow installed (pip3 install pillow)

Updates:

Scaled pi letter height, height was set based on an uppercase letter, but pi is lower case. The output size is now correct per the input.

Added a border to stop loosing the numbers around the very edges.
